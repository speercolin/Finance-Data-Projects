# Finance Data Projects

This repository is a collection of projects focused on data analysis, data engineering, and data science in the context of finance and banking. Each project explores various aspects of the financial world using real-world datasets, providing insights into fraud detection, market analysis, and much more.

### Projects Included

Each project within this repository is aimed at solving different problems related to the finance industry, ranging from predictive modeling to feature engineering, and involves a range of techniques including machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

#### Key Areas Covered:
- **Data Analysis**: Exploring financial data, uncovering insights, and providing actionable recommendations.
- **Data Engineering**: Working with large datasets, transforming raw data into clean, usable forms, and creating efficient pipelines.
- **Data Science**: Applying machine learning algorithms and statistical models to derive predictions and classifications from financial data.

### Current Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection

- **Description**: A machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions based on historical transaction data. The project includes the implementation of a RandomForestClassifier and evaluation through metrics like ROC-AUC score and confusion matrices.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Jupyter Notebooks.

### Repository Structure

Each project repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains datasets used across various projects. Datasets are large, so links to download them are provided in each project's specific `README.md` file.
- `src/`: Contains the code for specific projects. Each project folder may include:
  - Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts
  - Visualizations and analysis
  - Model building and evaluation
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the projects. Install them with:
  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
